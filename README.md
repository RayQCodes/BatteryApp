Battery Telemetry API
A Flask REST API for Battery Temperature & Utility Endpoints

Overview
This is a simple Flask REST API that provides mock battery telemetry data, date retrieval, and basic math operations.
It’s designed as a lightweight backend service for testing REST API development and integration.

Features
Battery Temperature API – Retrieve mock temperature readings for a given battery ID.

Math Endpoints – Addition and subtraction endpoints for quick testing.

Date Endpoint – Get the current server date/time.

Endpoints
Method	Endpoint	Description	Example Response
GET	/api/batteries/<battery_id>	Retrieve battery temperature by ID	[{ "battery_id": "100", "battery_type": "temp", "battery_temperature": "42" }]
GET	/num/<int:x>_<int:y>	Add two numbers	["total is", 7]
GET	/<int:x>&<int:y>	Subtract two numbers	{ "total Subtraction": 3 }
GET	/date	Get current server date/time	"2025-08-04T12:34:56"
